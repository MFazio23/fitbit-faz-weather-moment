# Faz Weather Moment
This is a custom clock face for the Fitbit Ionic and is a combination of [Fitbit's "Moment" clock face](https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-moment) and [Lee Doel's "Minimal Style" clock face](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/ff6b0f4a-026a-4228-b3f4-527904d862f1).

I created my own version in order to remove the activity switching (since I didn't care) and add weather instead of a battery level.

This is mainly just for my use, but if anyone wants to download the source and install it themselves, you'll just need to add in a valid OpenWeatherMap API key in the `apiKey` variable inside [companion/index.js](companion/index.js).
